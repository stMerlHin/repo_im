   [mainAxisAlignment](#mainaxisalignment) and 
   [internalMainAxisAlignment](#internmainaxisalignment) to make the RadioGroup be at the right place
   
 (@Required)
  ### children
    The item or the list of the items label of the RadioGroup. You can pass any widget or list of widget 
    you want but It's good to pass a Text widget or a list of Text widget like shown
